## Description:
    I generated a basic coding quiz that would allow the user to test their knowledge on coding. This quiz must be done in under two minutes and will notify the user if the answer is wrong or right. When the user is done with the quiz, they are promoted to enter their intials to add themselves to the leaderboard. From the home screen, they can see who holds the top spot. 
    
## Technolgy:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - Javascript

## Learned:
    I was able to do the HTML and CSS with some success and did not get confused. The javascript was the part that I was uncertain of. I kept trying to link back to sites but was unable to do so on some pages. Also the buttons where it showed the user only showed up for one of the questions but I am unsure why. I used Google inspect and nothing popped up wrong. I could not get the timer to display at all.
